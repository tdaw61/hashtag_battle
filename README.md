*Disclaimer*
 This is still very much a work in progress, this is one of my first Rails projects, and I still have a lot to learn.


 Known Bugs:
  -When changing from any view back to the /battles (index) view, the scroll nav and the header will not always show.


 Environment
   ruby 1.9.3
   rails 4.1

   sqlite database for development
   postgres for prod


 Github repo
  https://github.com/tdaw61/hashtag_battle

 Heroku deployment
  http://hashtag-battle.herokuapp.com/battles
  /battles is the index and functional home page. Just going to http://hashtag-battle.herokuapp.com will leave
  you with a blank page

  Test Suite
   - Generated by scaffolding, not fully functional.

   To deploy locally:
    -Pull from Github Repo
    -make sure to have rails version 4.1 and ruby version 1.9.3 installed
    -using rvm bundle update followed by a bundle install
    -finally rails server should get you up and running
